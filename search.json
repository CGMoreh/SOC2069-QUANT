Now, however, we will focus on understanding what that “regression line” is actually telling us.\nIn later exercises we apply the same techniques to replicate a small part of the regression model reported in Österman (2021) (specifically, model (1) in the summary Table 3, which is presented in more detail in Table A.3 in the Online Supplementary Material accompanying the article)\nFinally - probably outside class - you should practice the same linear regression modelling techniques on one of the assignment datasets and research questions.\n\n\n\nIf you haven’t yet downloaded it last week, download the Trust & Inequality (trust_inequality.dta) dataset from https://cgmoreh.github.io/SOC2069-QUANT/Data/\n\n\nAs a first step, create a scatter plot visualising the “relationship” (co-variation, joint distribution, …) between social trust (trust_pct) and inequality (inequality_s80s20). This is Exercise 2 from Week 3 - if you need a reminder of how to do it, check Week 3 Worksheet - Exercise 2 or your saved .jasp file containing your workshop analysis from Week 3.\n\n\n\nNow let’s dig deeper into the meaning of the regression line by building a simple bivariate linear regression model of social trust as a function of societal inequality (i.e. a model aiming to explain/predict values of social trust in various countries depending on the value of societal inequality in those countries).\nTo build a linear regression model in JASP, click through the Menu tabs:\n\\[ \\text{Regression} \\longrightarrow \\text{[Classical] Linear regression} \\] In the Linear regression panel, move the “social trust” variable to the \\(\\text{Dependent Variable}\\) box and the “inequality” variable to the \\(\\text{Covariates}\\) box.\nThe results from the linear regression model will appear in the outputs window on the right.\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nUsing the lecture slides and Chapter 7 (“Linear regression with a single predictor”) from the Introduction to Modern Statistics (IMS), interpret the meaning of the regression coefficient on “inequality”.\nAdd a note on the JASP output under the \\(\\text{Coefficients}\\) output and write down your interpretation there.

Region is the only Nominal categorical variable in this dataset, and categorical variables behave differently in regression models.\n\n\nTip: You have done this a few times in previous workshops. Check back on previous exercises if you need to remind yourself of how to create a frequency table.\n\n\n\nThe steps for fitting the regression, however, are very similar to what we have done in the previous exercise:\n\nClick through the Menu tabs:\n\n\\[ \\text{Regression} \\longrightarrow \\text{[Classical] Linear regression} \\]\n\nIn the Linear regression panel, move the “social trust” variable to the \\(\\text{Dependent Variable}\\) box\nBUT THIS TIME, we will move the Region variable to the \\(\\text{Factors}\\) box instead.\n\nThis will tell JASP that the Region variable is categorical and it should model it as such, treating each of its constituent categories as an individual factor/indicator variable, automatically leaving out the first category (Task 2.1 above will tell you which one that is!) from the model so that the left out category becomes the baseline/reference to which the coefficients on all the other categories compare. What happens here is that the left out category is absorbed into the “Intercept” (the unknown/unmeasured variation in the dependent variable).\nThe results from the linear regression model will appear in the outputs window on the right.\n\nQuestions\n\nUsing the lecture slides and the assigned readings from Introduction to Modern Statistics (IMS), interpret the meaning of the regression coefficients on each reported level of the Region variable;\nWhich one is the “reference”/“baseline” category?\nAdd a note on the JASP output under the \\(\\text{Coefficients}\\) output and write down your interpretation there.

    "text": "By the end of the session, you should be familiar with:\n\nsome important cross-national survey programmes\nhow to find, download and read data documentation, including survey questionnaires\nthe challenges of measuring sociological concepts\nunderstanding the JASP interface\n\n\n\n\nThe lecture has introduced the complexities of measuring sociological concepts. Throughout this short course, we will be using the measurement and estimation of social trust as a guiding example. However, the aim is to help you build up your skills and confidence in asking and addressing research questions of your own, and the assessment questions will ask you to analyse some other chosen research topic.\nIn this first IT workshop, you will begin your data analysis journey by exploring some online sources of cross-national sociological data available for secondary analysis, and you will practice performing basic descriptive analyses of selected variables.\n\n\n\nCreate a folder for this module on your institutional OneDrive (e.g. C:\\OneDrive - Newcastle University\\SOC2069). Within that folder, create a sub-folder called “Data”. You will then be able to save data files and documentation as you progress.\n\n\n\nAbout 20 minutes\n\nNavigate to the The World Values Survey (WVS) website and read about the World Values Survey.\n\n\nDon’t spend too much time browsing the website, but make sure you can answer the following questions:\n\nWhen was the WVS started, and how many waves of data collection have there been so far?\nIn which year(s) did the most recent wave of data collection take place?\nHow many countries were covered by the most recent wave?\nCan you name some of the topics covered by the WVS?\nWhat population are the national samples representative of?\nWhat is the general minimum sample size per country?\nIs the WVS data freely available for academic research purposes?\nDo you need to cite/reference the WVS data if you use it in your research?\nBonus: what is the difference between a time series dataset and a panel dataset, and which of the two can the WVS provide? (tip: look under Data and Documentation &gt; Data Download &gt; Timeseries (1981-2022) for a concise discussion)\n\n\n\nNavigate to Data and Documentation &gt; Data Download &gt; Wave 7 (2017-2022) page and explore the Questionnaire and Documentation. Download the Master Questionnaire and the Codebook documents and using the search function identify all the survey questions and variables that relate to “trust”.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nHow many questions relating to trust have you identified in the questionnaires?\nWhat is the difference between the questionnaire and the codebook?\nIn how many different ways is trust measured in the WVS?\nWhat are, in your opinion, the advantages and disadvantages of the different measurements of trust?\n\n\n\nWithin the “Data” sub-folder you created earlier, create another sub-folder called “WVS7”. You can now save the Master Questionnaire and the Codebook into that folder, and because it is stored on the institutional OneDrive, you will always have access to it on any computer, once you log in to your institutional Microsoft Windows account.\nIn the Select a country panel on the right side of the Wave 7 (2017-2022) page select one country at random and under Data files download the country-specific dataset (for consistency, download the first data type option, CSV (i.e. comma separated values)) to the “WVS7” subfolder you created earlier.\n\n\n\n\nAbout 20 minutes\nLet’s now navigate to The European Social Survey (ESS) and read about the survey. Try to answer to yourself the same questions as in the previous exercise\n\nNavigate to Data and then to the ESS Data Portal &gt; ESS Round 10 - 2020 &gt; ESS10 - Study Documentation. Download the ESS10 Source questionnaires to a newly created sub-folder called “ESS10”, and as in the previous exercise, identify all the survey questions and variables that relate to “trust”.\nNavigate to ESS Data Portal &gt; Datafile Builder (Wizard) and select one country at random at Round 10 (or 10SC). Keep all the variables (do not select any subsets in the “Select Variables” tab) and download the country-specific dataset in CSV format to your “ESS10” folder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTo be able to download data, you will need to register with the European Social Survey. Complete the registration before you can proceed\n\n\nYou now have a large amount of data at your fingertips. After a break, we will explore these data using a statistical software package\n\n\n\nAbout 30 minutes\nOpen the JASP software from the Start menu. If you are using your own laptop, you can install the latest version of JASP from https://jasp-stats.org/.\nThe opening page should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo open a dataset stored on your computer, you can navigate to the three horizontal bars (“hamburger”) menu icon &gt; Open &gt; Computer &gt; Browse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTo be able to see and load the data you downloaded from the WVS and ESS, you need to first extract the files from the compressed folder. Navigate to your Data folder outside the JASP data import window and extract your files, then return to the JASP window to open one of them.\n\n\n\nOpen the “WVS7” dataset. You should now see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can scroll up-down and left-right in the dataset to have a look at the spreadsheet and its contents.\nIn JASP you can work on one dataset at a time (or in one window). When you finish your analysis, you can save both the data and the outputs you generated as one .jasp file, which you can then open later and continue or alter your analyses.\nToday, we will explore some descriptive statistics using the Descriptives &gt; Descriptive Statistics menu option. If you click through, you should see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the survey questionnaire, identify the variable coding “social/generalised trust” and move that variable to the Variables field\nApart from the default Descriptive Statistics table, select Basic plots &gt; Distribution plots as well and interpret the distribution of the variable in your dataset\n\n\nQuestions\n\nHow many levels (categories) does the variable have in your dataset? is it what you had expected based on the questionnaire information?\nDoes the variables have any missing values in your dataset?\nWhat is the “Mode” of the variable, and what does that mean?\nWhat is the “Mean” of the variable, and what does that mean? Is it a useful statistic for this variable?\nWhat percentage of the respondents in your dataset had answered that “Most people can be trusted”?\n\n\nIf you see more than two levels/categories in your variable (and you are sure that you have chosen the correct variable), it means that in your dataset the variable contains some custom missing values. Missing values should be distinguished with a negative sign (e.g. -2). To set them as custom missing values, we can edit the dataset manually.\n\nClick on the Edit Data menu tab and scroll horizontally to your variable. Double-click on the variable column. In the middle tabs, check the label editor and identify any values that should be set as missing (e.g. -2). Click on the Missing values tab &gt; Use custom values and in the narrow field to the right type in the value you want to set as missing and click the + sign. You should be seeing something like below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can check back in the Label editor that the redundant value is not longer there.\n\nIn the same data editor window we can also make other changes to our variables. For example, let’s change the non-informative variable Name to something that better reflects the meaning of the variable, for example “soc-trust”, and let’s also give it a more descriptive Long name and even a Description if we want to. The Long name could be something like “Social trust”, and for the Description we could copy the original survey question out from the questionnaire: “Q57. Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?”.\n\nIn the *Label editor we should also attach labels to the values so that we can better read the outputs produced. We can copy the labels from the questionnaire here too: “1 = Most people can be trusted” and “2 = Need to be very careful”.\nYour data editor window should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nThe variable measurement level (Column type) appears as Ordinal. Is that correct? If you feel that the variable type should be changed, you can also do that here using the drop-down menu next to Column type.\n\nTo return to your data analysis, you can click on the Analyses menu tab. If you have changed the variable’s name, you can move it back to the Variables field to see the updated outputs.\n\nFind the other variables in the dataset that relate to social, interpersonal or institutional trust, and obtain similar descriptive statistics for them. Try to answer to yourself the same questions as above.\nAdd your notes to the Results output. By clicking on the small black down-arrowheads that appear next to the headings in the Results window when you hover over them with your mouse you can access small menu options that allow you to do various operations with the outputs (copy, save, edit, etc.), including the possibility to Add note. Your note will appear under the item to which it is added, and you can type in your note. The field acts as a basic text editor, which you can use to jot down your interpretation of the results and keep them close to the output. You can add in here your answers to some of the questions above.\n\nYour results and notes could look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame your analysis. Click through Hamburger menu tab &gt; Save as &gt; Computer &gt; Browse and save the analysis in your “WVS7” folder with the name “wvs7-example.jasp” (or anything else that you find useful). Once it’s saved, you can close the analysis. You can now open the .jasp file you saved and continue or modify the analysis you have started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor simplicity we have downloaded the dataset in CSV format, which is a simple plain text format that can be opened with text editors or spreadsheet tools such as Microsoft Excel. However, some other formats that belong to proprietary statistical software packages like SPSS or Stata are likely to store more information (e.g. variable and value label, etc.), and downloading the data in that format and importing it to JASP may make it easier to explore the data without needing to do too many manual changes.\nYou can experiment by downloading the data in another format (Stata appears to be the most stable for importing to JASP) and checking the data editor window.\n\n\n\nNow open a new JASP session and import the “ESS10” dataset you downloaded earlier, and perform a similar descriptive analysis on variables related to social, interpersonal and institutional trust you have done above. When complete, save that analysis to a .jasp file too.\n\n\n\n\nBelow are some research questions that you can choose from to address in Assignment 1:\n\nAre religious people more satisfied with life?\nAre older people more likely to see the death penalty as justifiable?\nWhat factors are associated with opinions about future European Union enlargement among Europeans?\nIs higher internet use associated with stronger anti-immigrant sentiments?\nHow does victimisation relate to trust in the police?\nWhat factors are associated with belief in life after death?\nAre government/public sector employees more inclined to perceive higher levels of corruption than those working in the private sector?\n\nFor now, choose one question that you find most sympathetic (you don’t need to stick with it for the assignment, but you could if you wanted to!). All of the questions can be answered with at least one of the survey datasets that you downloaded (the “WVS7” or “ESS10”) and often they both contain relevant variables.\n\nIdentify your “explanandum” - i.e. the core phenomenon/concept/behaviour/etc. that the research question aims to explain. The questions all postulate a relationship/association between two or more variables (the topic of next week), but for now, think carefully about the question and how it is formulated, and identify which is the variable that will be the target of explanation, and which variable (if mentioned) will be used for explaining it. For example, in the research question “Does education increase social trust?”, the variable we are interested in explaining is “social trust”, while “education” is the variable that we will use to explain it. In later weeks we will develop better vocabulary to describe associations between variables.\nOnce the core phenomenon to be explained is identified, look through the two survey questionnaires to identify any variables that might exist in the dataset that captures it. This may require some trial-and-error with testing out search words.\nOnce you have found one (or several) candidate variable(s), navigate to the relevant survey website and select a single country for which to download data. You will be working with single-country datasets for your assignment. Download the dataset, import it into JASP, find the relevant variable and perform some descriptive analysis on the chosen variable as you have done in the previous exercise.\nMake sure to add your noted and interpretations on the analysis results and save your analysis for later. You could create a new sub-folder for your “Assignment 1” work and save your analysis there for future use. If you end up liking your chosen question, you can continue this analysis next week.",

If you are using your own laptop, you can install the latest version of JASP from https://jasp-stats.org/.\nThe opening page should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\nTo open a dataset stored on your computer, you can navigate to the three horizontal bars (“hamburger”) menu icon &gt; Open &gt; Computer &gt; Browse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nTo be able to see and load the data you downloaded from the WVS and ESS, you need to first extract the files from the compressed folder. Navigate to your Data folder outside the JASP data import window and extract your files, then return to the JASP window to open one of them.\n\n\n\nOpen the “WVS7” dataset. You should now see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can scroll up-down and left-right in the dataset to have a look at the spreadsheet and its contents.\nIn JASP you can work on one dataset at a time (or in one window). When you finish your analysis, you can save both the data and the outputs you generated as one .jasp file, which you can then open later and continue or alter your analyses.\nToday, we will explore some descriptive statistics using the Descriptives &gt; Descriptive Statistics menu option. If you click through, you should see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the survey questionnaire, identify the variable coding “social/generalised trust” and move that variable to the Variables field\nApart from the default Descriptive Statistics table, select Basic plots &gt; Distribution plots as well and interpret the distribution of the variable in your dataset\n\n\nQuestions\n\nHow many levels (categories) does the variable have in your dataset? is it what you had expected based on the questionnaire information?\nDoes the variables have any missing values in your dataset?\nWhat is the “Mode” of the variable, and what does that mean?\nWhat is the “Mean” of the variable, and what does that mean? Is it a useful statistic for this variable?\nWhat percentage of the respondents in your dataset had answered that “Most people can be trusted”?\n\n\nIf you see more than two levels/categories in your variable (and you are sure that you have chosen the correct variable), it means that in your dataset the variable contains some custom missing values. Missing values should be distinguished with a negative sign (e.g. -2). To set them as custom missing values, we can edit the dataset manually.\n\nClick on the Edit Data menu tab and scroll horizontally to your variable. Double-click on the variable column. In the middle tabs, check the label editor and identify any values that should be set as missing (e.g. -2). Click on the Missing values tab &gt; Use custom values and in the narrow field to the right type in the value you want to set as missing and click the + sign. You should be seeing something like below:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can check back in the Label editor that the redundant value is not longer there.\n\nIn the same data editor window we can also make other changes to our variables. For example, let’s change the non-informative variable Name to something that better reflects the meaning of the variable, for example “soc-trust”, and let’s also give it a more descriptive Long name and even a Description if we want to. The Long name could be something like “Social trust”, and for the Description we could copy the original survey question out from the questionnaire: “Q57. Generally speaking, would you say that most people can be trusted or that you need to be very careful in dealing with people?”.\n\nIn the *Label editor we should also attach labels to the values so that we can better read the outputs produced. We can copy the labels from the questionnaire here too: “1 = Most people can be trusted” and “2 = Need to be very careful”.\nYour data editor window should look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion\nThe variable measurement level (Column type) appears as Ordinal. Is that correct? If you feel that the variable type should be changed, you can also do that here using the drop-down menu next to Column type.\n\nTo return to your data analysis, you can click on the Analyses menu tab. If you have changed the variable’s name, you can move it back to the Variables field to see the updated outputs.\n\nFind the other variables in the dataset that relate to social, interpersonal or institutional trust, and obtain similar descriptive statistics for them. Try to answer to yourself the same questions as above.\nAdd your notes to the Results output. By clicking on the small black down-arrowheads that appear next to the headings in the Results window when you hover over them with your mouse you can access small menu options that allow you to do various operations with the outputs (copy, save, edit, etc.), including the possibility to Add note. Your note will appear under the item to which it is added, and you can type in your note. The field acts as a basic text editor, which you can use to jot down your interpretation of the results and keep them close to the output. You can add in here your answers to some of the questions above.\n\nYour results and notes could look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSame your analysis. Click through Hamburger menu tab &gt; Save as &gt; Computer &gt; Browse and save the analysis in your “WVS7” folder with the name “wvs7-example.jasp” (or anything else that you find useful). Once it’s saved, you can close the analysis. You can now open the .jasp file you saved and continue or modify the analysis you have started.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nFor simplicity we have downloaded the dataset in CSV format, which is a simple plain text format that can be opened with text editors or spreadsheet tools such as Microsoft Excel. However, some other formats that belong to proprietary statistical software packages like SPSS or Stata are likely to store more information (e.g. variable and value label, etc.), and downloading the data in that format and importing it to JASP may make it easier to explore the data without needing to do too many manual changes.\nYou can experiment by downloading the data in another format (Stata appears to be the most stable for importing to JASP) and checking the data editor window.\n\n\n\nNow open a new JASP session and import the “ESS10” dataset you downloaded earlier, and perform a similar descriptive analysis on variables related to social, interpersonal and institutional trust you have done above. When complete, save that analysis to a .jasp file too.",

All of the questions can be answered with at least one of the survey datasets that you downloaded (the “WVS7” or “ESS10”) and often they both contain relevant variables.\n\nIdentify your “explanandum” - i.e. the core phenomenon/concept/behaviour/etc. that the research question aims to explain. The questions all postulate a relationship/association between two or more variables (the topic of next week), but for now, think carefully about the question and how it is formulated, and identify which is the variable that will be the target of explanation, and which variable (if mentioned) will be used for explaining it. For example, in the research question “Does education increase social trust?”, the variable we are interested in explaining is “social trust”, while “education” is the variable that we will use to explain it. In later weeks we will develop better vocabulary to describe associations between variables.\nOnce the core phenomenon to be explained is identified, look through the two survey questionnaires to identify any variables that might exist in the dataset that captures it. This may require some trial-and-error with testing out search words.\nOnce you have found one (or several) candidate variable(s), navigate to the relevant survey website and select a single country for which to download data. You will be working with single-country datasets for your assignment. Download the dataset, import it into JASP, find the relevant variable and perform some descriptive analysis on the chosen variable as you have done in the previous exercise.\nMake sure to add your noted and interpretations on the analysis results and save your analysis for later. You could create a new sub-folder for your “Assignment 1” work and save your analysis there for future use. If you end up liking your chosen question, you can continue this analysis next week.",

Identifying associations and patterns in a dataset, and setting up new research hypothesis based on them is often the most that we can realistically do with our data.\nMost often than not, however, our true aim is to set up a statistical model that can be used for making predictions or testing causal relationships about our phenomenon of interest.

    "text": "We begin our exploration of quantitative methods in sociology (and the social sciences more broadly) by thinking carefully about how we make the passage from theory and concepts to empirical data. For concepts to be explored empirically (not just theoretically), we need to operationalise them. The lecture introduces some core ideas behind social measurement in general. In the IT workshop, we will look more carefully at examples of how “social trust” has been conceptualised, operationalised and measured in practice.\nOnce empirical data have been collected, a first step in their analysis is to explore and describe the recorded variables using appropriate descriptive statistics. It may be that our research question is a very simple one and the whole purpose of the research was to describe the distribution of a measured concept or phenomenon. In most cases, however, descriptive statistics are but the first – albeit essential – step in the analytic process. In real-life research scenarios, we are more interested in drawing comparisons between cases and identifying associations (relationships) between various concepts and phenomena.

    "text": "Linear regression modelling is one of the most ubiquitous methods applied in the social sciences. It applies to cases where the phenomenon we aim to understand and describe (model) is ideally measured on a continuous numeric scale. This will be our “dependent” or “outcome” variable (our “explanandum”, the variable we want to explain). Regression modelling allows us to quantify the association between one or several explanatory (“independent”) variables and our outcome variable. This allows us to summarise associations and draw comparisons in our data more efficiently and to establish testable hypotheses about potential causal relationships.

    "text": "By the end of the session, you should be familiar with:\n\nhow to create and interpret cross-tabulations (contingency tables)\nhow to create some of the most commonly used plots to visually summarise relationships between two or more variables\nthe basic intuition behind “associations” among variables\n\n\n\n\nWe will continue where we left off last week, completing any exercises that remained unfinished. Then, using the same datasets that we downloaded last week (EVS7, ESS10), we tabulate or plot (as appropriate for the given data type) the relationship between the “social trust” variable and some other variables. We will then use a country-level dataset (available here) to reproduce the association between inequality and social trust presented in Figure 4.1 in Wilkinson and Pickett (2010).\n\n\n\nIn Week 2 you created a folder for this module on your institutional OneDrive storage drive (e.g. C:\\OneDrive - Newcastle University\\SOC2069) and within that a sub-folder called “Data”. You used that sub-folder to save the datasets downloaded as part of the exercises in the Week 2 Worksheet. If you haven’t go back to the Week 2 Worksheet and follow the guidance there to set up your folder structure for future use.\n\n\n\nIn Week 2 Worksheet - Exercise 3 we explored univariate distributions (i.e. single variables). As part of that exercise, you used country-specific data from the “World Values Survey, Wave 7”, which you downloaded directly from the WVS website. You may also have saved your work (and modified dataset) from Week 2 as a .jaspwith the name “wvs7-example.jasp” (or anything else that you found useful) as instructed in Week 2 Worksheet - Exercise 3 - Point 8. If so, you can open that file for this exercise and continue where you left off. Otherwise, follow the instructions in Week 2 Worksheet - Exercise 1 and 3 to download the WVS dataset (if needed) and load it into JASP.\nAs part of Week 2 Worksheet - Exercise 3 you have probably created a frequency table of the “social trust” variable. In this exercise, you will check how those frequencies are distributed across the levels of another categorical variables. For this purpose contingency tables are a useful tool.\n\nOpen the “WVS7” dataset. You should now see something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the survey questionnaire, identify the following two variables in the dataset: “social trust” and “sex”. In the original dataset these should be named Q57 and Q260, respectively (however, you may have already renamed the “social trust” variable as part of last week’s exercise). Using the Descriptives &gt; Descriptive Statistics menu option in JASP, create frequency tables for these two variables. You can request frequency tables for your variables in the Tables sub-option:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat percentage of the respondents in your dataset had answered that “Most people can be trusted”?\nWhat is the percentage of female respondents in your dataset?\nWhat are the variables’ measurement level (Column type)? Is that correct?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf the two variables were recorded as “Scale” in your dataset, then it is useful to change the column type (measurement level) to “Categorical”, which is the correct variable type for these two variables. We can do this by clicking on the Edit Data menu tab and scrolling horizontally to the variable of interest, then clicking on the data type icon next to the variable name and selecting the appropriate type for that variable; e.g.:\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you change the variable type, you will notice that the value labels appear in the frequency tables instead of their numeric values, making it easier to understand.\nIf the variables were recognised as “Ordinal” by the software, then the labels are also identified and used in outputs, just like with “Nominal” variables.\n\n\n\nAs a next step, we are interested in finding out the distribution of social trust among men and women. For this, we will create a contingency table. Use the Frequencies &gt; [Classical] Contingeny Tables menu option. Move the “social trust” variable to the Rows field and the “sex” variable to the Columns field.\nInterpret the Contingency Tables part of the output (you can hide the Chi-Squared Tests table form the output by un-ticking the \\(\\chi^2\\) option under the Statistics sub-menu). Expand the Cells sub-menu and experiment with the options.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nHow many women in your dataset answered “Need to be very careful?\nWhat percentage of the men in your dataset answered that “Most people can be trusted”?\nWhat percentage of those who answered “Most people can be trusted” are men, and what percentage are women?\nBased on your cross-tabulation, do women or men in your dataset have a higher level of “social trust”\n\n\n\nNow find a few other “Nominal” or “Ordinal” variables in the dataset and add them to the analysis. Repeat point 4 above with other combinations of variables. What happens if you add a third variable to Layers?\n\n\n\n\nFor this exercise and the next, we will use a different dataset: a dataset containing country-level (macro-) variables describing aggregate features of various societies. The dataset can be downloaded from this page, or through the link below (where you can also read a brief description of the dataset):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Trust & Inequality: trust_inequality.dta – Download\n\n\n\n\n\nThis dataset combines data on “generalised/social trust” from the latest waves of the World Values Survey and the European Values Study with macro(country)-level data on World Development Indicators (WDI) provided by the World Bank. The main variables of interest taken from the WDI refer to measurements of economic inequality within countries. The dataset allows to replicate - using the latest available data - the analysis of the relationship between inequality and trust presented in Chapter 4 (“Community life and social relations”, pp. 49-62) of Wilkinson and Pickett (2010).\n\n\n\n\nDownload the dataset to your Data (sub)folder and open it in JASP\nCreate summary descriptive statistics for all the variables in the dataset (Descriptives &gt; Descriptive Statistics menu option).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBecause there are only a few variables in the dataset, you can select them all by clicking one of them, then Ctrl + A, and moving them all over to the Variables box\n\n\nBecause we have quite a few variables to display, it’s better to transpose (rotate) the table so that the variable names are listed in the rows and the summary statistics in the columns. Tick the Transpose descriptives table box for this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new descriptive analysis in your JASP session (Descriptives &gt; Descriptive Statistics menu option). This will keep the summary statistics table you created earlier. In this new analysis, play around with the univariate descriptions that you are already familiar with and create a few frequency tables and plots for each variable. Make sure to chose the most appropriate tabulation/visualisation option for the given variable type\nNow let’s explore the relationship between “inequality” and “social trust” using a scatter plot.\n\n\nCreate another new descriptive analysis in your JASP session (Descriptives &gt; Descriptive Statistics menu option), to keep your univariate descriptives above intact on the output page.\nMove the two variables over to the Variables box. The variable measuring “social trust” at the country level is trust_pct (% of respondents in the given country who answered “Most people can be trusted” to the standard social trust question in the WVS/EVS), while the variable measuring “inequality” is inequality_s80s20 (a commonly employed measure of income inequality representing the ratio between the total net disposable income of the 20% of people having the highest income (S80) and the total net disposable income of the 20% of people having the lowest income (S20))\nExpand the Customizable plots option and tick Scatter plots\nPlay around with the options under Scatter plots to simplify the plot (e.g. remove the univariate distributions of the variables displayed on the margins/changed them to histograms, remove the regression line, etc.). You can also manually increase the size of the plot by dragging the bottom-right corner\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat is the scatter plot telling us? Note down everything that comes to your mind.\n\n\n\nNow play around with the variables and check the association between some other Scale type variables in the dataset using scatterplots.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat happens if you add the Region variable to the Split box?\nTry to interpret what this tri-variate plot is telling us\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate another new descriptive analysis in your JASP session (Descriptives &gt; Descriptive Statistics menu option), to keep your previous analysis above intact on the output page.\nWe will now check the distribution of “social trust” in different world regions using box plots. Move the trust_pct variable to the Variables box and the Region variable to the Split field. You can resize the output graph so that the Region labels are easier to see.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat is the box plot telling us? Note down everything that comes to your mind. You can use the lecture slides to remind yourself of the information contained in box plots.\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding on the work you have done in Week 2 Worksheet - Exercise 4, open the dataset you have used to address one of the questions below.\n\nIdentify (the) two main variables relevant to the question, perform univariate descriptive statistics, and check their relationship using one of the plots/tabulations practised in the previous exercises above.\nSelect some other variables of different types and check their association with your main dependent variable using the plots/tabulations practised in the previous exercises above.\n\nReminder of the research questions to choose from to address in Assignment 1:\n\nAre religious people more satisfied with life?\nAre older people more likely to see the death penalty as justifiable?\nWhat factors are associated with opinions about future European Union enlargement among Europeans?\nIs higher internet use associated with stronger anti-immigrant sentiments?\nHow does victimisation relate to trust in the police?\nWhat factors are associated with belief in life after death?\nAre government/public sector employees more inclined to perceive higher levels of corruption than those working in the private sector?\n\nFor now, choose one question that you find most sympathetic (you don’t need to stick with it for the assignment, but you could if you wanted to!). All of the questions can be answered with at least one of the survey datasets that you downloaded (the “WVS7” or “ESS10”) and often they both contain relevant variables.",

Note down everything that comes to your mind.\n\n\n\nNow play around with the variables and check the association between some other Scale type variables in the dataset using scatterplots.\n\n\nQuestions\n\nWhat happens if you add the Region variable to the Split box?\nTry to interpret what this tri-variate plot is telling us",
